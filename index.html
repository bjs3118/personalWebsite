            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am an undergraduate Electronic and Information Engineering student at Imperial College, London. I have experience in the entire stack of modern networked computers, from the design and architecture of CPUs such as MIPS, to the information theory and wireless protocols connecting it to the internet, and the operating systems and databases providing back-end support in the cloud. </p>
            <br> 
            <p>I have recently completed my second year of study with a first and Dean's list award (top 10% of their academic year) </p>
            <br>
            <p>Prior to university, I worked as a watersports instructor in the UK and overseas.  I have taught both adults and children in groups and individually. I have also led off-the-water activities and worked in hospitality.  Through this experience, I have developed skills in teamwork, self-organisation, team management and customer service.</p>
